## Introduction
This project is an open source implementation of an MSX2 compatible computer. The project is built using a combination of 1980's era components - Z80 CPU, V9958 VDP, AY-3-8910/YM2149F PSG, 8255 PPI, 7400-series logic, and some newer components, such as 512 KiB SRAM and 512 KiB Flash ROM and a few simple programmable logic devices (ATF16V8B SPLDs).
